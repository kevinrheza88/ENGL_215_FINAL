        "Red Faces" is a poem by Gertrude Stein. In the ted talk we saw, many people incorrectly identified this poem
        as being written by a robot. Many people make this incorrect assumption because Stein's style in this poem
        matches closely with what we expect a robot written poem to be. Such aspects include some poor grammar and
        incomplete sentences which we assume are relics of the robot's poor work but are actually deliberate choices
        of Stein.

    <l>Red flags the reason for pretty flags.</l>
    <l>And ribbons.</l><!-->"And ribbons" is an incomplete sentence. If it has been suggested to the reader that this
    poem may have been written by a robot, the reader might mistakenly take this grammatically incorrect sentence as a
    sign that it was written by a robot</-->
    <l>Ribbons of flags</l>
    <l>And wearing material</l>
    <l>Reason for wearing material.</l>
    <!-->Stein intends to repeat the concept of the flags and uses "ribbons" as anaphora for flags. However, a reader
    who is looking for signs that a poem may have been written by a robot may miss this and simply regard the lines as
    a sentence that makes no logical sense. This is further exasperated by the fact that the sentence has no real rhyme
    scheme or structure. In our minds we assume that this lack of structure might come from a robot's inability to
    understand such structure. </!-->
    <l>Give pleasure.</l>
    <!-->Another incomplete sentence, this continues to suggest to the reader that the hand of the author is not human.
    </-->
    <l>Can you give me the regions.</l>
    <l>The regions and the land.</l>
    <l>The regions and wheels.</l>
    <l>All wheels are perfect.</l>
    <l>Enthusiasm.</l>
    <!-->These last few lines are much closer to what we expect human poetry to sound like. They have real structure and
    clearly show us the message of the poem, people's enthusiasm about their own national flags. The trouble is that
    these lines occur at the end of the poem rather than the beginning. Humans rarely change their mind about anything
    once they formed their opinion on a subject. Therefore, since the reader has already formed the theory that the poem
    is written by a robot, they are unlikely to change their views in light of the more human-like style. If the lines
    of the poem had been reversed, it is likely that fewer people would mistake this poem as being written by a robot

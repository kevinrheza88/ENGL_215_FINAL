                    The Elements by Alixandra Bamford is a concrete poem that serves as the opposite of the previous unnamed poem made by the bot.
                    This poem is recognizable as being written by a human due to it's very intentional form, with more focus on whitespace and spacing that is not possible to directly
                    type. In contrast to the unnamed poem this poem uses it's whitespace to create a lightning structure as opposed to the words.

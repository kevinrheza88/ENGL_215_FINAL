                    This untitled poem was written by a bot developed by Zackary Scholl, boasting an impressive rate of 80% of people believing the poem was written by a human.
                    The main things to look at in this poem are the form and repeated phrases. The form focuses mostly on the words as opposed to the whitespace, with the words forming
                    a lightning-like structure. I believe the reason most peope assume this poem is written by a human is because of it's use of form, however it may be seen through by 
                    the heavy repetiion.

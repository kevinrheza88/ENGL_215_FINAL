                    Taroko Gorge is a computer-generated poem created in 2009 by Nick Montfort, a poet and professor of digital media at 
                    MIT. It is a nature-themed poem named after a Taiwanese national park. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to scroll 
                    infinitely, ceaselessly producing new lines of poetry until the web page is either closed or refreshed. Montfort 
                    wrote the code that underpins the poem, defining what words get used in the poem, and how they should be structured 
                    to form grammatically correct sentences. Beyond that, the computer is largely left on its own to decide how these 
                    words are to be remixed to create poetic-sounding language. Due to the dynamic and infinite nature of the poem, I 
                    chose to annotate the first fourteen lines of a version of the poem that was generated the first time I opened the 
                    web page one day. My goal in these annotations was to answer our central question: Can computers write poetry? To 
                    this end, I focused my annotations on the organization of the words, as that is the element of the poem that the 
                    computer has the most control over. Does the organization of the words - the sentences they form, line breaks between 
                    them, etc. feel natural, like they were made by a human? Or do they instead feel stiff and robotic, like they were 
                    made by a computer? This is all explored in the subsequent annotations.

                    Overall, I'd say that this is an example of computers writing poetry on par with a human, but just barely.
                    Some lines feel very computer-like, as they contain the bare minimum necessary to form a grammatically correct sentence, such as "Stones rest." which only contains a one-word subject and predicate.
                    However, other lines are more complex and feel like they could be written by a human, like "The crag trails the basin."
                    So the poem ultimately does just enough to make you feel like this could be written by a human.

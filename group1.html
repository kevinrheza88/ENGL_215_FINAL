			<h2>Group One: Languages</h2>

			<p>	Introduction: Many poetry schemes and techniques are dependant on the language they are written in. Words may rhyme 
				in one language, but their direct translations do not. Thus, when poems are translated into other 
				languages, whether through computers or human translators, a lot of these poetic techniques are lost 
				or changed to accomodate the new language. Other times, different techniques are reintroduced to retain 
				the poem's status as a poem in the new language. The following poems in this jamboard are used to examine 
				how language and translation influences their constructions and reconstructions.</p>

			<h3>Jabberywocky by Lewis Carrol</h3>

			<p>Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol is a poem composed largely of nonsense words that manage to remain understandable. 
				This poem serves as an interesting introduction to the ideas of language, translation, and how the expectations 
				of a reader affect the meaning of a poem or even words themselves. The fact that Jabberwocky can be understood 
				despite its usage of nonsense words suggests that there is some kind of intrinsic understanding in language that 
				is separate from the meaning of individual words. There are passages in Jabberwocky where part of speech and context 
				easily provide a potential translation for the nonsense word. On the other hand some words could be interpreted a number 
				of ways but the general story of the poem remains the same. While details are lost through lack of understanding, 
				the most fundamental elements of Jabberwocky's story are preserved even without being able to examine word choice with nuisance. 
				This scenario provides interesting insight into the meaning of words in poetry which can help demonstrate the effects of translation.</p>

			<h3>Drinking Alone in the Moonlight by Li Bai</h3>

			<p>	Li Bai was a poet from 8th century China. The following poem, "Drinking Alone in the Moonlight," is regarded as one of his best works. 
				However, there are multiple English versions of the poem, most likely a result of multiple translations. How do these poetic translations 
				compare to a computer-generated translation--arguably the most direct translation--and what does this reveal about translating poetry over two 
				vastly different languages?</p>

			<p>	The original Chinese poem is featured in the next slide with a translation of the poem made by Google Translate, followed by two English versions 
				that are found on multiple websites.</p>

			<h3>The Odyssey by Homer</h3>

			<p>The Odyssey is one of the most well known works of classical Greek literature. While it has certainly been well preserved, many modern translations 
				strip the work of many of its poetic traits. The poem was originally preserved orally so it was important for it to be rhythmic almost like a catchy 
				song so it would be easier to remember. However, as it has been written down and translated into languages where those initial rhythmic traits aren't 
				as easily preserved that element has been lost. Recently a translator named Emily Wilson made an effort to translate the work into mostly iambic pentameter 
				to more accurately reflect the way the poem might have sounded to a historical Greek reader at the expense of some changes to word choice and order. While Wilson's 
				translation tells the same story, it is at times very different then the original. However it preserves an element that would be lost via even the most faithful
				of direct translations.</p>

			<h3>Demain dès l'aube by Victor Hugo</h3>

			<p> "Demain dès l'aube" is a well-known poem from French author and poet, Victor Hugo, originally written in his native French. Being romance languages, 
				English and French are similar to each other in some respects and have a long history of translation between each other. The particular translation 
				in the next slide, done by French teacher Camille Chevalier-Karlif, is an example of applying a more literal translation to a poem. As will be seen, 
				such a translation removes what made the original French poem work. English readers can still identify it as a poem since the stanza and line structures 
				remain, but the French's syllable and rhyming schemes are not translated over.</p>

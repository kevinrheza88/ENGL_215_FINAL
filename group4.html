			<p>Central Question: Can computers write poetry?</p>

			<h3>Taroko Gorge by Nick Montfort</h3>

			<p>Taroko Gorge is a computer-generated poem created in 2009 by Nick Montfort, a poet and professor of digital media at 
				MIT. It is a nature-themed poem named after a Taiwanese national park. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to scroll 
				infinitely, ceaselessly producing new lines of poetry until the web page is either closed or refreshed. Montfort 
				wrote the code that underpins the poem, defining what words get used in the poem, and how they should be structured 
				to form grammatically correct sentences. Beyond that, the computer is largely left on its own to decide how these 
				words are to be remixed to create poetic-sounding language. Due to the dynamic and infinite nature of the poem, I 
				chose to annotate the first fourteen lines of a version of the poem that was generated the first time I opened the 
				web page one day. My goal in these annotations was to answer our central question: Can computers write poetry? To 
				this end, I focused my annotations on the organization of the words, as that is the element of the poem that the 
				computer has the most control over. Does the organization of the words - the sentences they form, line breaks between 
				them, etc. feel natural, like they were made by a human? Or do they instead feel stiff and robotic, like they were 
				made by a computer? This is all explored in the subsequent annotations.</p>
			<p><lg type="para"> <!-- Each line group forms a verse paragraph. According to the Poetry Foundation a verse paragraph is group of verse lines that make up a single rhetorical unit. -->
				<pre n="1">The <w type="subject">crag</w> <span type="predicate">trails the basin</span>.</pre>
				<pre n="2"><w type="subject">Stones</w> <span type="predicate">rest</span>.</pre>
				<pre n="3"><w type="subject">Forest</w> <span type="predicate">commands the shapes</span>.</pre>
			</lg>

			<lg> 
				<pre n="4"><space quantity="2" unit="chars"></space><span type="imperative">translate the encompassing dim -</span></pre> <!-- Space after every stand-alone line. The space is only 2 characters wide so it's not enough to be a normal indent. -->

				<pre n="13"><w type="subject">Shape</w> <span type="predicate">roams the stones</span>.</pre>
			</lg>
			<br>
			<lg>
				<pre n="14"><space quantity="2" unit="chars"></space><span type="imperative">shade the encompassing rough arched -</span></pre>
			</lg>
			<!--
				Overall, I'd say that this is an example of computers writing poetry on par with a human, but just barely.
				Some lines feel very computer-like, as they contain the bare minimum necessary to form a grammatically correct sentence, such as "Stones rest." which only contains a one-word subject and predicate.
				However, other lines are more complex and feel like they could be written by a human, like "The crag trails the basin."
				So the poem ultimately does just enough to make you feel like this could be written by a human.

			<h3>Red Faces by Gertrude Stein</h3>

			<p>"Red Faces" is a poem by Gertrude Stein. In the ted talk we saw, many people incorrectly identified this poem
				as being written by a robot. Many people make this incorrect assumption because Stein's style in this poem
				matches closely with what we expect a robot written poem to be. Such aspects include some poor grammar and
				incomplete sentences which we assume are relics of the robot's poor work but are actually deliberate choices
				of Stein.</p>
			<p><pre>Red flags the reason for pretty flags.</pre>
				<pre>And ribbons.</pre><!-->"And ribbons" is an incomplete sentence. If it has been suggested to the reader that this
				poem may have been written by a robot, the reader might mistakenly take this grammatically incorrect sentence as a
				sign that it was written by a robot</-->
				<pre>Ribbons of flags</pre>
				<pre>And wearing material</pre>
				<pre>Reason for wearing material.</pre>
				<!-->Stein intends to repeat the concept of the flags and uses "ribbons" as anaphora for flags. However, a reader
				who is looking for signs that a poem may have been written by a robot may miss this and simply regard the lines as
				a sentence that makes no logical sense. This is further exasperated by the fact that the sentence has no real rhyme
				scheme or structure. In our minds we assume that this lack of structure might come from a robot's inability to
				understand such structure. </!-->
				<pre>Give pleasure.</pre>
				<!-->Another incomplete sentence, this continues to suggest to the reader that the hand of the author is not human.
				</-->
				<pre>Can you give me the regions.</pre>
				<pre>The regions and the land.</pre>
				<pre>The regions and wheels.</pre>
				<pre>All wheels are perfect.</pre>
				<pre>Enthusiasm.</pre>
				<!-->These last few lines are much closer to what we expect human poetry to sound like. They have real structure and
				clearly show us the message of the poem, people's enthusiasm about their own national flags. The trouble is that
				these lines occur at the end of the poem rather than the beginning. Humans rarely change their mind about anything
				once they formed their opinion on a subject. Therefore, since the reader has already formed the theory that the poem
				is written by a robot, they are unlikely to change their views in light of the more human-like style. If the lines
				of the poem had been reversed, it is likely that fewer people would mistake this poem as being written by a robot

			<h3>The Elements by Alexandra Bamford</h3>

			<p>The Elements by Alexandra Bamford is a concrete poem that serves as the opposite of the previous unnamed poem made by the bot.
				This poem is recognizable as being written by a human due to it's very intentional form, with more focus on whitespace and spacing that is not possible to directly
				type. In contrast to the unnamed poem this poem uses it's whitespace to create a lightning structure as opposed to the words.</p>

			<h3>untitled poem by a bot developed by Zackary Scholl</h3>

			<p>This untitled poem was written by a bot developed by Zackary Scholl, boasting an impressive rate of 80% of people believing the poem was written by a human.
				The main things to look at in this poem are the form and repeated phrases. The form focuses mostly on the words as opposed to the whitespace, with the words forming
				a lightning-like structure. I believe the reason most peope assume this poem is written by a human is because of it's use of form, however it may be seen through by 
				the heavy repetiion.</p>

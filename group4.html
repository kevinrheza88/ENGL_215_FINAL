			<p>Central Question: Can computers write poetry?</p>

			<h3>Taroko Gorge by Nick Montfort</h3>

			<p>Taroko Gorge is a computer-generated poem created in 2009 by Nick Montfort, a poet and professor of digital media at 
				MIT. It is a nature-themed poem named after a Taiwanese national park. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to scroll 
				infinitely, ceaselessly producing new lines of poetry until the web page is either closed or refreshed. Montfort 
				wrote the code that underpins the poem, defining what words get used in the poem, and how they should be structured 
				to form grammatically correct sentences. Beyond that, the computer is largely left on its own to decide how these 
				words are to be remixed to create poetic-sounding language. Due to the dynamic and infinite nature of the poem, I 
				chose to annotate the first fourteen lines of a version of the poem that was generated the first time I opened the 
				web page one day. My goal in these annotations was to answer our central question: Can computers write poetry? To 
				this end, I focused my annotations on the organization of the words, as that is the element of the poem that the 
				computer has the most control over. Does the organization of the words - the sentences they form, line breaks between 
				them, etc. feel natural, like they were made by a human? Or do they instead feel stiff and robotic, like they were 
				made by a computer? This is all explored in the subsequent annotations.</p>

			<h3>Red Faces by Gertrude Stein</h3>

			<p>"Red Faces" is a poem by Gertrude Stein. In the ted talk we saw, many people incorrectly identified this poem
				as being written by a robot. Many people make this incorrect assumption because Stein's style in this poem
				matches closely with what we expect a robot written poem to be. Such aspects include some poor grammar and
				incomplete sentences which we assume are relics of the robot's poor work but are actually deliberate choices
				of Stein.</p>

			<h3>The Elements by Alixandra Bamford</h3>

			<p>The Elements by Alixandra Bamford is a concrete poem that serves as the opposite of the previous unnamed poem made by the bot.
				This poem is recognizable as being written by a human due to it's very intentional form, with more focus on whitespace and spacing that is not possible to directly
				type. In contrast to the unnamed poem this poem uses it's whitespace to create a lightning structure as opposed to the words.</p>

			<h3>untitled poem by a bot developed by Zackary Scholl</h3>

			<p>This untitled poem was written by a bot developed by Zackary Scholl, boasting an impressive rate of 80% of people believing the poem was written by a human.
				The main things to look at in this poem are the form and repeated phrases. The form focuses mostly on the words as opposed to the whitespace, with the words forming
				a lightning-like structure. I believe the reason most peope assume this poem is written by a human is because of it's use of form, however it may be seen through by 
				the heavy repetiion.</p>

			<p>Comments: Clear reading order, structure focuses on the words (not the whitespace). "depths of the storm" and "lines on the ceiling" follow the same wording format 		</p>
